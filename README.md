## Incentivised Tech Bin

It is a reward based system on the right disposal of waste, implemented using a face recogniton system to add reward points to a user account.  The reward points can be exchanged for multiple goodies on our website.

The dustbin will have multiple compartments for segregation of waste. A Machine Learning algorithm will segregate the waste into organic and recyclable. Once the type of waste is detected, the waste will go into the right compartment. Along with this, the system will keep track of the amount of waste in the bin and notifications will be sent out accordingly in order avoid waste accumulation for long durations of time.
